# ðŸ“Œ Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

Capstone Project | Summer Analytics 2025

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project addresses the inefficiencies caused by static pricing in urban parking lots. We developed a dynamic, real-time pricing engine that updates parking fees based on demand, queue length, traffic conditions, and special events. The solution uses real-time data streaming and logic-based modeling to improve parking lot utilization.

## ðŸ”„ Project Architecture and Workflow

1. **Data Streaming**: The dataset (CSV) is read using `Pathway` in streaming mode with one row per second simulation.

2. **Model 1 (Linear)**:

   * Computes price based on occupancy rate.
   * Formula: `Price = BasePrice + Î± * (Occupancy / Capacity)`
   * Serves as a baseline.

3. **Model 2 (Demand-Based)**:

   * Constructs demand based on occupancy, queue length, traffic, special day, and vehicle type.

   * Demand formula:

     `Demand = Î± * (Occupancy / Capacity) + Î² * QueueLength - Î³ * Traffic + Î´ * IsSpecialDay + Îµ_vehicle`

     `Price = BasePrice * (1 + Î» * NormalizedDemand)`

   * Normalized demand ensures smooth and bounded pricing (0.5x to 2x base).

4. **Real-Time Windows**:

   * Daily tumbling windows used for smoothing fluctuations.

5. **Visualization**:

   * Bokeh plots are created in Panel.
   * Users can interactively view prices per lot and compare with competitors.

6. **Output**:

   * All processed results are streamed and saved to `parking_stream.csv`
